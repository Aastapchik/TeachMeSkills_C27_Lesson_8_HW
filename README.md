# TeachMeSkills_C27_Lesson_8_HW

The program simulates the work of a clinic. Let there be three doctors in the clinic: a surgeon, a therapist and a dentist.
Every doctor has a method of “treating,” but every doctor treats differently.

There is also a “Patient” class with a “Treatment Plan” field and a “Doctor” field.

An object of the “Patient” class is created and a treatment plan is added to the patient.

The therapist has created a method that will prescribe a doctor to the patient according to the plan
treatment:
If the treatment plan has code 1, appoint a surgeon and perform the treatment method.
If the treatment plan has code 2, appoint a dentist and perform the treatment method.
If the treatment plan has any other code, assign a therapist and perform the method
treat.
